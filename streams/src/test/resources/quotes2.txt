The Picts were a tribal confederation of peoples who lived in
what is today eastern and northern Scotland during the Late
Iron Age and Early Medieval periods.

Pictish society was typical of many Iron Age societies in
northern Europe, having "wide connections and parallels"
with neighbouring groups.
